How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the big that was introduced?

  Because it shows the lines that are diferent between both files.

  It also show the number of the lines that are different in both documents.

  It is really fast and easy to spot the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

  first because a stop carying about changes because if i do something wrong i know that there is a copy

  It can also be more creative without thinking about loosing my work.

  It makes me learn from mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

  I think it is possible to forget to commit something important.

  But if it commit automatically you wont know what exactly happened in each commit and it can be too much or not enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  Because on change can affect other documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  I use git log when I want to see the history of the commits and
  I use git diff whe I want to compare 2 different commit, I do it with the commit id.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

  I dont need to care about saving copies of everything in diferent directories because there are always copies made in git

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  To control the vserion of my proyects
